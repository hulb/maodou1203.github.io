  This paper proposes an approach to protect image content against malicious
  tampering based on watermarking technology. The watermark is composed of two
  kinds of check bits which are used for tampered region localization, and one
  recovery bit which is used for image recovery and is embedded into the
  three-Least Significant Bit planes of the original image. The first check bit
  is generated by applying the proposed Parity Check Bit Labeled method to each
  pixel, and the other is generated by employing hashing algorithm to each block
  after image decomposition. The superposition result detected from the two
  check bits contributes to lowering the probability of false-negative errors.
  Moreover, we propose a post-processing method Adaptive Structural Element
  Calculation which improves the accuracy of tamper detection result further.
  Experimental results show that our algorithm has good performance in keeping
  high quality of recovered image, and meanwhile improving the accuracy of
  tamper detection result.
