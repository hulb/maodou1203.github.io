  This article proposes an adaptive scheme for image tampered region
  localization and content recovery. To generate the watermark information
  comprised of the authentication data and recovery data, we firstly propose the
  Adaptive Authentication Feature Calculation algorithm to obtain the
  authentication data, which includes the information of block location and
  block feature. The DWT-based Block Feature Calculation method is then proposed
  to calculate the block feature, and the quantization method is employed to
  calculate the block location. The recovery data is composed of self-recovery
  bits and mapped-recovery bits. The self-recovery bits are obtained by the Set
  Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees encoding algorithm. For retrieving the
  damaged codes caused by tampering, we propose the Diagonal Mapping algorithm
  and apply it to the self-recovery bits, thus generating the mapped-recovery
  bits, to provide a guarantee of recovery data. Experimental results show the
  superior performance of the proposed scheme in terms of tamper detection and
  image recovery, by comparing with the state-of-the-art works. The results
  demonstrate that the proposed method shows efficiency in the adaptiveness,
  well localization, strong capability for image recovery, and the effectiveness
  of attack resistance.
